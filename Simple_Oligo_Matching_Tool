### Simple_Oligo_Matching_Tool V6_EN.py

- **Function**: This script analyzes how specific oligonucleotides (short DNA or RNA molecules) match within a given DNA sequence. Essentially, it compares the sequence of a given primer or oligo with the target DNA sequence to identify matching sections and provides these results to the user.
- **Usage**: Researchers can use this tool to assess the specificity of primers for certain DNA sequences or to select suitable oligos for experiments targeting specific regions.

### intersection_analysis_part V2_EN.py

- **Function**: This script, part of the Simple_Oligo_Matching_Tool, performs the task of finding the intersection of DNA record IDs from multiple CSV files. It is used to identify DNA sequences that are commonly observed across different experimental conditions or experimental groups.
- **Usage**: This analysis helps determine which DNA sequences repeatedly appear across multiple datasets, aiding in understanding the importance or ubiquity of these sequences.

### primer_verification_part V7_EN.py

- **Function**: This script, also part of the Simple_Oligo_Matching_Tool, verifies how well given primers function against DNA sequences. It evaluates whether the primers accurately recognize and amplify the expected DNA regions, automating the process of experimental verification to confirm the efficacy of the primers.
- **Usage**: The script provides crucial information for optimizing or modifying primers to be used in PCR experiments, by assessing the efficiency and specificity of the primers.

Each script is designed to perform specific tasks related to DNA sequence analysis, enabling researchers to achieve precise results in their experimental design and data analysis processes.
